/**
* This module contains the MQTT client listener classes.
* They can be used to listen for events raised by the
* W.I.S.E. process using MQTT. Event types include scenario
* completion, simulation completion, and statistics.
*
* Example
* -------
*
* ```javascript
* let wise = new WISE();
* //********** setup your W.I.S.E. job here **********
* //add some statistics to listen for. They will be emitted at
* //the end of each timestep for all scenariosd
* prom.timestepSettings.addStatistic(TimestepSettings.STATISTIC_SCENARIO_CURRENT_TIME);
* prom.timestepSettings.addStatistic(TimestepSettings.STATISTIC_SCENARIO_NAME);
* //start the job
* let job = await wise.beginJobPromise();
* //create a new manager to listen for events
* let manager = new JobManager(job.name.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, ''));
* //listen for new statistics events
* manager.on('statisticsReceived', (args) => {
*     //args will be of type StatisticsEventArgs
* });
* //listen for new scenario complete events
* manager.on('scenarioComplete', (args) => {
*     //args will be of type ScenarioCompleteEventArgs
* });
* //listen for new simulation complete events
* manager.on('simulationComplete', (args) => {
*     //args will be of type SimulationCompleteEventArgs
* });
*
* await manager.start(); //connect to the MQTT broker
* ```
